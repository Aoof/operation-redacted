No 067: Agent, we need you to recover the sensitive "Shay" files from an abandoned mental hospital. This is a delicate operation, so be discreet.
Agent: Understood. What can you tell me about the hospital? What challenges am I likely to face?
No 067: The place is in disrepair, but the power is still on. You'll have to navigate a labyrinth-like layout to find the file room. Watch out for deranged former patients roaming the halls - you'll need to be stealthy.
Agent: Sounds risky. Can you provide any additional support or equipment?
No 067: Unfortunately, no extraction team. Your best bet is to recover the files quietly. You might find some tools to aid you but your priority is to get the files, and get out without drawing attention.
Agent: I'll do my best to complete this mission discreetly. I'll report back once the files are recovered.
No 067: Good luck, Agent. Time is critical. Retrieve those files and get out safely.
